Hello, and welcome on my GitHub profile!

## { 💻 **CODING EXPERIENCE** }
>I started coding in 2021, with **flowcharts** and **Visual Basic .NET**. After mastering those languages (not to the maximum) in 1 year, in summer 2022 I started learning **Java**, and I'm still doing so.

## { 🔍 **LOOKING TO THE FUTURE** }
>At the moment, I'm looking to become a Full Stack Web Developer with proper learning. If that doesn't work, I will look for other ways to become a developer (software for example, but it will be thougher than web developing).
